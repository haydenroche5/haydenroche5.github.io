      <description>The 4th Ave Train Spotter is a piece of technology I helped develop with the good people at Cohub, a software company based out of Nashville, TN. My dad, Steve, and brother, Elliott, both help run the company. Cohub&amp;rsquo;s office is located in the Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood of Nashville, where railroad tracks cross over two roads, 4th Avenue and Chestnut Street. Several times a day, trains cross over these roads. Sometimes, the crossings are quick, while other times, the train can sit parked at the intersection for 45+ minutes, not letting any cars by.</description>
