      <description>Code for this post can be found here.
I recently encountered an interesting problem while working on a system that can detect cat meows in a real-time audio stream. One of the critical components in this system is a machine learning model that can take in audio data and classify it as containing a meow or not. To train the model, I need a bunch of audio clips of meows and a bunch of clips of not-meow sounds.</description>

      <description>The 4th Ave Train Spotter is a piece of technology I helped develop with the good people at Cohub, a software company based out of Nashville, TN. My dad, Steve, and brother, Elliott, both help run the company. Cohub&amp;rsquo;s office is located in the Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood of Nashville, where railroad tracks cross over two roads, 4th Avenue and Chestnut Street. The trains passing through can be quick, or they can take their time.</description>
