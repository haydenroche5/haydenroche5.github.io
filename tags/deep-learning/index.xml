      <description>The 4th Ave Train Spotter is a piece of technology I helped develop with the good people at Cohub, a software company based out of Nashville, TN. My dad, Steve, and brother, Elliott, both help run the company. Cohub&amp;rsquo;s office is located in the Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood of Nashville, where railroad tracks cross over two roads, 4th Avenue and Chestnut Street. The trains passing through can be quick, or they can take their time.</description>
