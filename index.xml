      <description>Code for this post can be found here.
I recently encountered an interesting problem while working on a system that can detect cat meows in a real-time audio stream. One of the critical components in this system is a machine learning model that can take in audio data and classify it as containing a meow or not. To train the model, I need a bunch of audio clips of meows and a bunch of clips of not-meow sounds.</description>

      <description>The 4th Ave Train Spotter is a piece of technology I helped develop with the good people at Cohub, a software company based out of Nashville, TN. My dad, Steve, and brother, Elliott, both help run the company. Cohub&amp;rsquo;s office is located in the Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood of Nashville, where railroad tracks cross over two roads, 4th Avenue and Chestnut Street. The trains passing through can be quick, or they can take their time.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal website! I&amp;rsquo;m Hayden Roche, a technologist based out of Chicago, IL. In September 2019, I left my job as a hardware/FPGA engineer at a high frequency trading firm and am currently studying computer vision and machine learning while I wait out a one year non-compete agreement. On this site, you&amp;rsquo;ll find guides and posts on various topics, including Linux (I&amp;rsquo;m an Ubuntu user) and my computer vision and ML journey.</description>
